A practitioner of thaumaturgy is a thaumaturge, thaumaturgist or miracle worker.<br /><br />This is what this mod is all about - drawing magic from physical objects in the form of Essentia and reshaping it to perform miracles.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/j2UT9.png\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />The first thing you will need to craft is a wand. The first one available to you is the Iron Capped Wooden Wand crafted as shown here (using a stick and iron nuggets):<br /><br /></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6z2jPqq.png\" alt=\"\" />&nbsp;<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aKNOrYy.png\" alt=\"\" /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />You then place a bookshelf in the world and right click on it with the wand.

More importantly they do so without breaking the balance of my mod (such as it is).<br /><br />A friendly request to addon makers:<br />\r\n<div>I love all the addons that have been made recently, but I have a few requests.<br />- Don't go too crazy when adding new aspects. If you do, drop me a PM. If it is something obvious or useful beyond your addon I might add it to vanilla TC. :)<br />- Try not to add more than one research tab<br />- Please try and keep your own researches on your own tab<br />- Please don't move my researches around. You can make copies if you wish to show dependendies on your tab, but the research should remain in its original location.<br />- Please don't alter any of my recipes. If you feel it is needed for the balance of your addon please drop me a PM. Partly to discuss if the change is required, but mostly since it might actually be a change that should be in vanilla TC.<br /><br />Lastly, I've noticed some addons adding items from TC 3 or earlier. I don't have a problem with that, so go wild. However several of those items I have been planning to re-add myself. A lot of TC 2 stuff never made it into TC 3 simply due to time constraints. So don't come crying to me if and when I do that. :)<br />Note - I obviously won't just copy-paste someones elses code for those items or blocks - I will implement my own versions.<br /><br />If you want access to beta version of my mod to make version update go a bit smoother, send me a PM with your dropbox user info and a link to your mod (so I can check if you are actually an addon dev :P )</div>\r\n<br />-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1813058-thaumic-tinkerer-thaumcraft-addon-evolve-knowledge-v102\">Thaumic Tinkerer</a><br />-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2090604-16x-thaumcraft-addon-mob-aspects/\">Thaumcraft Mob Aspects</a><br />-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/2196652-164\">Electric Magic Tools</a><br /><br />Texture Packs<br />-&nbsp;<a href=\"http://soartex.net/downloads/mods/\">Soartex</a></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><strong>Mod Packs</strong></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The code of &ldquo;Thaumcraft for Minecraft&rdquo; in source or binary form is the intellectual property of Azanor. See below for copyright, terms and conditions.<br /><br />As a habit I ignore every PM in regards to mod-packs - both private and public. Everything you need to know about them is listed here.<br /><br />You want Thaumcraft in your mod pack? All you need to meet are five simple conditions:<br />1. Your mod pack needs a link back to this forum post.<br />2. You cannot make any money off of the mod pack.<br />3. You cannot claim that you made any part of the mod, and you must give credit to the author of the mod (Azanor).<br />4. If I ever ask you to remove my mod from your pack, for whatever reason, you do so.<br />5. Handle any queries and bug reports internally first. This is one of the main reasons I had such a strict anti-modpack policy for such a long time - people using modpacks would come here posting errors that have nothing to do with my mod or that have been fixed ages ago, but still occurs in the modpack because it is using an older version.<br /><br />If these five conditions are met, then you have my permission to use it in a mod pack.<br /><br /></div>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Special thanks to...</strong></p>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">My&nbsp;Beta Testers, you know who you are :)</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">All the folks on the&nbsp;Forgecraft&nbsp;server for your help and support.</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Dan Scott&nbsp;</strong>(&nbsp;for all the help he gave me with some of the sprites.</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>mr.Hazard(d95)&nbsp;</strong>for his awesome models<br /><strong>Lorc</strong>, creator of the icons I use for enchanting and other things<br /><strong>bonemouse</strong>, creator of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/242175-16x10-isabella-10v2-many-small-improvements-dec-19-2011/\">Isabella Texture Pack</a>&nbsp;for letting me use his chest textures and skin as well as&nbsp;ScottKillen&nbsp;for making the Thaumium armor graphics based on the Isabella pack.<br /><strong>chicken_bones&nbsp;</strong>for letting me base my lightning effect and deploader code from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-100181-chickenbones-mods/\">WRCBE</a><br /><strong>CovertJaguar&nbsp;</strong>for his custom biome spawning code.<br /><strong>Rorax&nbsp;</strong>for allowing me to use some of her models.<br /><strong><a href=\"http://www.jwbjerk.com/art\">J.
